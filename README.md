# Phase 2 Final Project Specifications

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Phase 2. 

## Objectives

* Understand all required aspects of the Final Project for Phase 2
* Understand all required deliverables
* Understand what constitutes a successful project

### Final Project Summary

Another phase done--you're half way there!

For the culmination of Phase 2, you just need to complete the final project!

### The Project

For this project, you'll be working with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company. Here's the schema for the Northwind database:

The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be of value to the company. 

## The Deliverables

The goal of your project is to query the database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis. In this statistical analysis, you'll need to perform a hypothesis test (or perhaps several) to answer the following question:

**_Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?_**

In addition to answering this question with a hypothesis test, you will also need to come up with **_at least 3 other hypotheses to test on your own_**.  These can by anything that you think could be imporant information for the company. 

For this hypothesis, be sure to specify both the **_null hypothesis_** and the **_alternative hypothesis_** for your question.  You should also specify if this is a one-tail or a two-tail test. 

To complete this project, you will need to turn in the following 4 deliverables:

There are three deliverables for this project:

### A GitHub repository
### A Jupyter Notebook
### A non-technical presentation

Keep in mind that the audience for these deliverables is not only your teacher, but also potential employers. Employers will look at your project deliverables to evaluate multiple skills, including coding, modeling, communication, and domain knowledge. You will want to polish these as much as you can, both during the course and afterwards.

We provide a few resources to help you understand what makes for good deliverables. - The rubric associated with this assignment - A template for you to use, with an example for reference.

### GitHub Repository

Your GitHub repository is the public-facing version of your project that your instructors and potential employers will see - make it as accessible as you can. At a minimum, it should contain all your project files and a README.md file that summarizes your project and helps visitors navigate the repository.

### Jupyter Notebook

Your Jupyter Notebook is the primary source of information about your analysis. At a minimum, it should contain or import all of the code used in your project and walk the reader through your project from start to finish. You may choose to use multiple Jupyter Notebooks in your project, but you should have one that provides a full project overview as a point of entry for visitors.

#### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your jupyter notebook should meet the following specifications:

**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  
<br>  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.  
<br>      
* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  
<br>    
* Any SQL code written to source data should also be included.  

**_Findings_**

* Your notebook should clearly show how you arrived at your results for each hypothesis test, including how you calculated your p-values.   
<br>
* You should also include any other statistics that you find relevant to your analysis, such as effect size. 

### Non-Technical Presentation

Your non-technical presentation is your opportunity to communicate clearly and concisely about your project and it's real-world relevance. The target audience should be people with limited technical knowledge who may be interested in leveraging your project. For Phase 2, these would be business executives interested in making decisions about an effective use of discounts. We recommend using Google Slides, PowerPoint or Keynote to create your presentation slides.

#### Non-Technical Presentation Must-Haves

Your presentation should:

* Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:
<br>  
    * A high-level overview of your methodology  
    <br>  
    * The results of your hypothesis tests  
    <br>  
    * Any real-world recommendations you would like to make based on your findings (ask yourself--why should the executive team care about what you found? How can your findings help the company?)  
    <br>  
* Take no more than 5 minutes to present  
<br>  
* Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.
